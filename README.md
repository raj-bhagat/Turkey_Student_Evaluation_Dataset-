## Decision Tree
Our objective is to predict that the student will pass in a given subject in his/her first attempt based on the teacher evaluation given by the student. 
Decision tree classifier requires a target concept so i made a target concept from "nb.repeat" coloumn and named it "Eligibility". The idea is if the nb.repeat is more than 1 then the student will not pass in first attempt.
